The participants have the opportunity to use and experiment with the newest and most exciting technologies in the fields of molecular biology and genetics. This way they can accomplish even their wildest dreams in the area of biological engineering and propose solutions to many trending humanity problems in medicine, ecology, energetics, livelihood etc. Meanwhile, these young people get to know the not less exciting aspect of organizing teams, finding sponsorships and successfully completing high-tech projects.

We are certain that we Bulgarians are capable of competing equally with the best in the world of science and technologies and even overperform them. We are striving to give the young Bulgarians a chance to unfold their potential in our homeland and we hope that many of them will stay and be enterprising and active citizens, which will help in building a better Bulgaria."
